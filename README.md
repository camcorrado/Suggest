# Suggest

Suggest is a virtual suggestion box, where employees and employers can work together toward creating a better work environment. 

Employees can leave anonymous suggestions, modify and delete their suggestions, upvote other users' suggestions, and view previously approved suggestions to get an idea of what goals are achievable.

Employers can view suggestions made by employees and approve them.

## Motivation

As my first full-stack project, I wanted to work with features I was familiar with: let the idea be the variable and the constant be the technologies. I have previously created web apps that are based on leaving reviews, creating lists, logging notes, etc. Suggest implements many features used in those previous web apps.
