# Suggest

Suggest is a virtual suggestion box, where employees & employers can work together toward creating a better work environment.

Employees can leave anonymous suggestions, modify & delete their suggestions, upvote other users' suggestions, & view previously approved suggestions to get an idea of what goals are achievable.

Employers can view suggestions made by employees & approve them.

## Motivation

As my first full-stack project, I wanted to work with features I was familiar with: let the idea be the variable & the constant be the technologies. I have previously created web apps that are based on leaving reviews, creating lists, logging notes, etc. Suggest implements many features used in those previous web apps.
